# Djangoapp

My bachelor's degree project.

## Technologies
The project is a web app made in python django framework 4.1.6. For the project I also used pandas 1.5.1, numpy 1.23.4 for data analysis. Also: SciPy 1.9.3, Sci-kit Learn 1.2.2 and TMDBsimple wrapper 2.9.1. For the front end I used pure HTML and CSS. 
## Database
During my studies, when app was hosted, I used my own movie database, with data used on education licence. Now the database is no longer available.
## Features
You can sign up new account and then sign in. Using your account you can rate movies from 1 to 10, you can see list of movies available on website, manage your rated movies list and generate recommendations (and also see them after generating in separate section).
## Algorithms
There are 3 algorithms of recommendation - based on Euclidean distance, SVD and Randomized SVD, which use Gaussian distribution to predict matrix values.
